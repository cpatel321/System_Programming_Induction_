# Question 3:
## Bianry Bounty

Given file for download was a file easily openable with archive manager(7zip I have used ).
find_flag archive consisted 36 files.
I went through each file and tried to look for words like flag and CTF in it.
I file name .text had this in it's 3rd line 

CTF{1mm4H�_h4ck3rmH��@���H��H���H�h4ck3rm4H�nn_n0w}

After removing extra H and @  and unknowns(�) and also after a few hit and trial from another account I got the flag.
